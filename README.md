# GNSS-GPS
Python
This project is part of my Internship Project NARL(National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL) at Gadanki near Tirupati, an autonomous society supported by DOS).
Under the Supervission of Dr. Nirvikar Dashora, Sci./Engr.-SF,
Ionospheric and Space Physics Group, NARL 

The aim of our project is to understand RINEX file formats and reformatting the file format based on the requirements
using python programing language. The reformatting of RINEX file data done by considering deferent parameter’s like Type satellites,
RINEX Versions, frequency, Order of the header records, order of data records, Missing items, duration of the validity of values, 
Event flag records, Receiver clock offset, Channel numbers as pseudo-observables etc.


In this project the efficiency of the program is going to be increased and speed of the execution of programme is going to be increased.
The batch process is implemented, for RINEX versions 3.03, 3.02 and 2.11 by this the user can run the multiple files simultaneously, 
and additionally programme provides menu option’s to select the number of satellite data to extract so this feature will reduce the 
size of the file, the RINEX version’s is a standard for storing all the data needed for all kinds of GNSS2 positioning and navigation. 
This standard format provides means to seamless store data transmitted from GPS3, GLONASS4, GALILEO5 end GEO6/SBAS7 satellites, 
as well as meteorological data and the fundamental observations made by GNSS receivers (code, phase, Doppler and time). 
The whole aim of our project is to support research activities and experiments by reducing time which required while extracting 
the data from whole file. And its versatility and the good quality of its documentation made RINEX the standard of choice for data 
input in all kinds a post processing techniques, both in real-world production works as in research and development projects.
